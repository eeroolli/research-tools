feature: Optimize extraction flow with GREP-first approach and enhance metadata editor

Extraction Flow Optimization:
- Restructured process_paper() to prioritize fast identifier extraction (GREP + API lookup) before GROBID fallback
- Changed from GROBID-first to GREP-first approach (2-4 seconds vs 5-10+ seconds for papers with DOIs)
- Leverages existing metadata_processor.process_pdf() optimized workflow
- Maintains all error handling while improving speed for papers with identifiers

Centralized DOI Normalization:
- Added normalize_doi() static method in IdentifierValidator for consistent DOI cleaning
- Updated all API clients (PubMed, OpenAlex, CrossRef) to use centralized normalization
- Eliminates code duplication and ensures consistent behavior across codebase

Manual DOI Entry Enhancement:
- Made DOI entry always available in metadata editor, independent of Zotero items
- Added validation with clear feedback (valid/invalid messages)
- Auto-normalizes common DOI formats (https://doi.org/, doi:, etc.)
- Optional metadata fetching when valid DOI entered and no existing metadata
- Retry mechanism for invalid DOIs

Tags Display Enhancement:
- Added _get_tags() method in ZoteroLocalSearch to fetch tags from SQLite database
- Tags included in all search results (DOI search, title fuzzy search, author-ordered search)
- Tags displayed first when selecting Zotero items (right after title, before authors)
- Added tags to search result normalization

Minor:
- Update config.conf documentation for API priority settings
- Clarified comments regarding priority system (1 = highest, 9 = lowest)
- Added guidance for setting priorities based on research focus
